# Lakehurst Gothic

Lakehurst Gothic is a typeface based on the lettering used by the United States Navy's LTA (lighter-than-air) program. The names emblazoned along the sides of the envelopes of the great airships bear a resemblance to Bank Gothic (a contemporary) and Microgramma, but with several key differences that give them a character all their own.

As there are few orthographic depictions of the face, and because it was likely hand-painted on the vessels' hulls, the design has been copied primarily by eye, using Bank Gothic as a general guide for characters missing from available samples. A measure of artistic license has also been employed to make the face appear more consistent and aesthetically pleasing when not used solely for typesetting the names of Navy airships.

## Improvements

- I'm hoping to include additional characters, such as those with diacritical marks, in future updates.
- I may adjust or improve characters if research reveals new samples.
